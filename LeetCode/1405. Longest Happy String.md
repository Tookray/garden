Consider the input `a = 0`, `b = 8`, and `c = 11`. Then a sample solution is `ccbccbbccbbccbbccbc`. If we decided to greedily "spend" 2 `b`s at every interval, we would get the solution `ccbbccbbccbbccbbcc` which is incorrect!

Perhaps the solution is to get `a`, `b`, and `c` to be equal in count, and we just spend them 1 at a time like `abc-abc-abc-...`.

```python
def longestDiverseString(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> str:
	S = ""

	COUNT = 0
	CHAR  = 1

	previous = None

	while a > 0 or b > 0 or c > 0:
		x, y, z = sorted([(a, "a"), (b, "b"), (c, "c")], reverse=True)

		if x[CHAR] == previous:
			if y[COUNT] == 0:
				# Edge case for when we can fit 1 more character.
				#
				# Input:  (a=0, b=8, c=11)
				# Output: "ccbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbc"  (wrong)
				#         "ccbcbcbcbcbcbcbcbcc" (right)
				if x[COUNT] > 0 and S[-2] != x[CHAR]:
					S += x[CHAR]

				break

			x, y = y, x

		used = 0

		if x[COUNT] - y[COUNT] > 2:
			S += x[CHAR] + x[CHAR]

			used = 2

		else:
			S += x[CHAR]

			used = 1
			
		match x[CHAR]:
			case "a":
				a -= used
			case "b":
				b -= used
			case "c":
				c -= used

		previous = x[CHAR]

	return S
```
