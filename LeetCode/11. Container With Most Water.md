I think this is a subarray-esque problem—as in, we are looking for a subarray—and looking at the input constraints, it looks like it can be solved in $O(n)$ time.

```python
def maxArea(height: List[int]) -> int:
	n = len(height)

	best = 0

	L, R = 0, n - 1 

	while L < R:
		area = min(height[L], height[R]) * (R - L)
		best = max(best, area)
	
		if height[L] < height[R]:
			L += 1
		else:
			R -= 1

	return best
```

Incrementing the smaller height is quite intuitive. A (narrower) subarray can only be a solution if and only if its heights exceed to current best (wider) subarray.

However, what happens when `height[L] == height[R]`? Which pointer should we increment or decrement? In the above code snippet, we decrement `R`, but how does it guarantee the optimal solution?

To show what I mean,

```python
def maxArea(height: List[int]) -> int:
	n = len(height)

	best = 0

	L, R = 0, n - 1 

	while L < R:
		area = min(height[L], height[R]) * (R - L)
		best = max(best, area)

		if height[L] < height[R]:
			L += 1

		elif height[L] > height[R]:
			R -= 1

		else:
			# We can increment either `L` or `R`, it doesn't matter. The
			# immediate next area will be smaller than the current area.

			if L + 1 < R:
				next_area = min(height[L + 1], height[R]) * (R - (L + 1))

				assert area > next_area

			if L < R - 1:
				next_area = min(height[L], height[R - 1]) * ((R - 1) - L)

				assert area > next_area

			match randint(0, 1):
				case 0:
					L += 1
				case 1:
					R -= 1

	return best
```

Again to reiterate, a narrower (relative to the current best) subarray can be a solution if and only if both its height exceeds the current best's heights. The implication is that said subarray requires that both the `L` and `R` pointer to be incremented and decremented, respectively. So at the end of day, it doesn't matter which one we move since we will need to both regardless if there exists a narrower subarray whose area is larger than the current best.
