The description is poor, and the question feels like an "easy." We can get a trivial $O(n)$ solution by converting the input to a `set` and iterating through the `list`.

```python
def numComponents(head: Optional[ListNode], nums: List[int]) -> int:
	nums = set(nums)

	cc = 0         # Number of connected components.
	status = False # Whether the current node is part of a connected
	               # component.

	current = head

	while current:
		num = current.val

		if num in nums:
			if status == False:
				cc += 1

			status = True

			nums.remove(num)

		else:
			status = False

		current = current.next

	return cc
```
