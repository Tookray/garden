An intuitive solution is to compute the set that contains every width $H$ and another set that contains every height $V$. We then intersect the two sets, find the largest element, and return its corresponding area.

```python
def maximizeSquareArea(m: int, n: int, hFences: List[int], vFences: List[int]) -> int:
	H = [1] + sorted(hFences) + [m]
	V = [1] + sorted(vFences) + [n]

	HS = set()
	VS = set()

	for h1 in H:
		for h2 in H:
			if h1 != h2:
				HS.add(abs(h2 - h1))

	for v1 in V:
		for v2 in V:
			if v1 != v2:
				VS.add(abs(v2 - v1))

	S = HS & VS

	if S:
		s = max(S)

		return (s * s) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
	else:
		return -1
```

The question is, how much more efficient can the algorithm be? I think this is as good as it gets, however, I could apply some small optimizations.

```python
def maximizeSquareArea(m: int, n: int, hFences: List[int], vFences: List[int]) -> int:
	hFences.extend([1, m])
	vFences.extend([1, n])

	hFences.sort()
	vFences.sort()

	H = set()

	for i in range(len(hFences)):
		for j in range(i + 1, len(hFences)):
			H.add(hFences[j] - hFences[i])

	S = -1

	for i in range(len(vFences)):
		for j in range(i + 1, len(vFences)):
			v = vFences[j] - vFences[i]

		if v in H:
			S = max(S, v)

	return (S * S) % (10 ** 9 + 7) if S != -1 else -1
```
