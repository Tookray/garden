Intuition tells me that I need to sort the input (`start` then `end`) but before we try to come up with a solution, let's think about some test cases.

For an input `[[1, 3], [1, 3], [1, 3], [2, 4]]`, the solution is `4` (we can attend all the events):

![[1353-1.excalidraw]]

But what if we consider shorter events that start later? For example, consider the input `[[1, 4], [1, 4], [1, 4], [3, 3]]`.

![[1353-2.excalidraw]]

Clearly, we are able to attend all `4` events, however, the pitfall is that if we chose to attend on the third day for the third event, we would be able to only attend `3` events!

"Backtracking" seems like a poor idea because of a case like this:

![[1353-3.excalidraw]]

So what is the proposed solution?

>[!done] Key idea
>Use a [[Priority Queue]] to keep track of the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">events that we are able to attend today</mark>â€”the end day being the priority (so we'll use a min-heap).

As we iterate through the sorted events

1. We add events that we are able to attend.
2. Attend the event that ends the soonest (which increments our day).
3. Remove any events that we are no longer able to attend (current day is past the end day).

The algorithm is [[Greedy]], as shown by step two, but why does this work? <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">It's because each event is worth the same</mark>, whether I attend a short event or a long event, I am still attending one event. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">If two events end on the same day, it doesn't matter which one I choose to attend, I will only be able to attend one of them.</mark>

```python
def maxEvents(self, events: List[List[int]]) -> int:
	START = 0
	END   = 1

	# Sort by start day.
	E = sorted(events)

	# Min-heap of events that we are able to attend today.
	# Contains the end day of said events.
	PQ = []

	attended = 0

	# Event index.
	e = 0
	N = len(events)

	while e < N or PQ:
		# There are no events to attend, let's fast forward to the
		# start of the closest next event.
		if not PQ:
			day = E[e][START]

		# Add events that start today.
		while e < N and E[e][START] == day:
			_, end = E[e]
			heappush(PQ, end)

			e += 1

		# Greedily attend the event that ends the earliest.
		heappop(PQ)
		attended += 1

		day += 1

		# Remove all the events that we cannot attend anymore.
		while PQ and PQ[0] < day:
			heappop(PQ)

	return attended
```
