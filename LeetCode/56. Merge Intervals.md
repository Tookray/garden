I don't think there is a $O(n)$ time solution, I think the best I can do is sort then merge which will have a runtime of $O(n \log n)$.

```python
def merge(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
	START = 0
	END   = 1

	intervals.sort()

	I = []

	i = 0

	for j, (start, end) in enumerate(intervals):
		# There are three variations that we need to consider.
		#
		# [   ]
		# [      ]
		#
		# or
		#
		# [   ]
		#    [   ]
		#
		# or
		#
		# [   ]
		#       [   ]
	
		# Case 1: i-th interval is a sub-interval of j-th interval.
		if intervals[i][START] == start:
			i = j

			continue

		# Case 2: i-th interval and j-th interval overlaps.
		if start <= intervals[i][END]:
			intervals[i][END] = max(intervals[i][END], end)

			continue

		# Case 3: i-th interval and j-th interval are disjoint.
		I.append(intervals[i])

		i = j

	# Final interval.
	I.append(intervals[i])

	return I
```
