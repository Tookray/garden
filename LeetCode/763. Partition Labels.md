The first idea I get is to create intervals where a character exists. For example,

```
 'b' interval
 vvvvv
ababcbacadefegdehijhklij
^^^^^^^^^
'a' interval
```

If interval $I_1$ is completely contained in interval $I_2$, then we can discard interval $I_1$. For example, in the above example, since $b$ interval is contained in $a$ interval, we would discard $b$ interval.

Now that I think about it, at this point, the problem boils down to [[56. Merge Intervals]].

```python
def partitionLabels(s: str) -> List[int]:
	START = 0
	END   = 1

	# Step 1: compute the character intervals.
	I = {}

	for i, ch in enumerate(s):
		if ch in I:
			I[ch] = [I[ch][START], i]
		else:
			I[ch] = [i, i]

	# Step 2: merge intervals.
	I = sorted(I.values())

	S = []

	i = 0

	for j, (start, end) in enumerate(I):
		# Case 1: i-th interval is a sub-interval of j-th interval.
		if I[i][START] == start:
			i = j

			continue

		# Case 2: i-th interval overlaps j-th interval.
		if start <= I[i][END]:
			I[i][END] = max(I[i][END], end)

			continue

		# Case 3: i-th interval and j-th interval are disjoint.
		S.append(I[i])

		i = j
	
	S.append(I[i])

	return [end - start + 1 for start, end in S]
```
