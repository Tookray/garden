This problem reminds me of the [[354. Russian Doll Envelopes]] problem.

The $O(n^2)$ dynamic-programming approach is.

```python
def bestTeamScore(self, scores: List[int], ages: List[int]) -> int:
	AGE = 0
	SCORE = 1

	A = zip(ages, scores)
	A = sorted(A)

	# Now we just do a variation of the longest increasing subsequence.

	solution = [x[SCORE] for x in A]

	for i, (age, score) in enumerate(A):
		highest = score
		
		for j in range(i):
			conflict = A[i][AGE] > A[j][AGE] and A[i][SCORE] < A[j][SCORE]

			if not conflict:
				highest = max(highest, score + solution[j])

		solution[i] = highest

	return max(solution)
```

You could probably optimize it further to $O(n \log n)$ by using binary search.
