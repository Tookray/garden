From the problem statement, we know that we'll have to use a heap.

>[!quote]
>Return an array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` represents the <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">count of the most frequent id in the collection</mark> after the `i`th step.

From one of the constraints, we know that the heap will always be non-empty with each pair of `(count, id)` having `count >= 0`.

>[!done] Key idea
>For each iteration `i`, if the `head` of our heap's value is out-of-date (i.e. it's `count` does not reflect the current ID's `count`), then we remove the `head`. We repeat the remove step until we get a valid (in-sync) `head`.

Once you understand the key idea, the implementation becomes trivial.

```python
def mostFrequentIDs(nums: List[int], freq: List[int]) -> List[int]:
	solution = []

	# The last known count (of current frequency) for an ID.
	last_known = defaultdict(int)

	# Our heap will contain pairs.
	COUNT = 0
	ID = 1

	heap = []

	for n, f in zip(nums, freq):
		last_known[n] += f

		heappush(heap, (-1 * last_known[n], n))

		# If the value's frequency does not reflect what we remember that
		# means that the heap node is out of date!
		while last_known[heap[0][ID]] != -1 * heap[0][COUNT]:
			heappop(heap)

		solution.append(-1 * heap[0][COUNT])

	return solution
```
