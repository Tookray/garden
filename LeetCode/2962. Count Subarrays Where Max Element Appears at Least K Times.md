A subarray problem is often solved in $O(n)$ time using a sliding window.

From the problem statement, it's pretty obvious that we need to find the largest element `M`â€”this will take $O(n)$ time.

Now suppose that we have a `subarray` of `nums` that contains exactly `k` counts of `M`.

![[2962-1.excalidraw]]

We can see that there is a gap to the left and right of `subarray`, denoted as `a` and `b` respectively. The gap extends left (or right) until the next (or previous) instance of `M`.

For the left gap, we can select between `0..=a` elements, and for the right gap, we can select between `0..=b` elements while ensuring that `subarray` contains `k` counts of `M`!

><mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">This is just a permutation problem</mark>, so the total number of subarray-variations for this instance of `subarray` is $(a + 1)(b + 1)$.

The problem that we face is that we want to avoid repeatedly counting the same subarray multiple times (otherwise we will get the wrong answer!). So what is the proposed solution?

>[!done] Key idea 2
>For each index, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">consider only the subarray up to this index</mark>.

Then the implementation is as follows.

```python
def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
	max_element = max(nums)

	indices = []

	for i, num in enumerate(nums):
		if num == max_element:
			indices.append(i)

	n = len(indices)

	# No subarray satisfies the requirement.
	if n < k:
		return 0

	solution = 0

	# I need to move a window of size 'k' in 'indices'.
	window_count = n - k + 1

	for i in range(window_count):
		start = indices[i]
		end   = indices[i + k - 1]

		if i == window_count - 1:
			# This is the last window.
			solution += (start + 1) * (len(nums) - end)
		else:
			next = indices[i + k]

			solution += (start + 1) * (next - end)

	return solution
```

We perform a (fixed-width) sliding window across the indices of `M` in `nums`.
