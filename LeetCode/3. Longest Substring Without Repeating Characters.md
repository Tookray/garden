Since we are looking for the longest substring (subarray), we can just use [[Kadane and Sliding Window]] algorithm. To keep track of what our substring contains, we can use a `set` data structure.

The implementation is trivial.

```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
	S = set()

	best = 0

	l = 0

	for r, char in enumerate(s):
		while char in S:
			S.remove(s[l])
			l += 1

		S.add(char)

		best = max(best, len(S))

	return best
```
