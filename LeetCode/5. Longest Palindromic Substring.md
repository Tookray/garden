Given that the input size for this problem is at most `1000`, the optimal solution probably has a runtime of $O(n^2)$.

>How can we use smaller palindromes to compute a larger palindrome?

Yes we can. For example if we know that `aba` is a palindrome, then can check if `?aba?` is also a palindrome for some arbitrary `?` in $O(1)$ time.

Since a <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">palindrome can have even or odd number of elements</mark>, we will need to consider both cases.

Since we know that our runtime will be $O(n^2)$ and checking if a (sub)string is a palindrome takes $O(1)$ time, we can just check every single substring!

```python
def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
	n = len(s)

	solution = ""

	def longest(L: int, R: int) -> str:
		nonlocal solution

		while L - 1 >= 0 and R + 1 < n and s[L - 1] == s[R + 1]:
			L -= 1
			R += 1

		if R - L + 1 > len(solution):
			solution = s[L:R + 1]

	for i in range(n):
		# Odd case.
		longest(i, i)

		if i < n - 1 and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
			# Even case.
			longest(i, i + 1)

	return solution
```

After looking around there [[Manacher]]'s algorithm which has a $O(n)$ runtime!
