I think this is just a fixed-width variation of [[Kadane and Sliding Window]] algorithm, so the runtime is probably $O(n)$.

We can use a `map` (counter) to keep track of how many distinct elements we have and keep a running sum as we increment the left and right pointers.

```python
def maxSum(nums: List[int], m: int, k: int) -> int:
	n = len(nums)

	MS, S = 0, 0               # Max sum and current sum.
	C = defaultdict(lambda: 0) # Counter.

	for r in range(k):
		num = nums[r]

		S += num
		C[num] += 1

	if len(C) >= m:
		MS = S

	for r in range(k, n):
		l = r - k

		S = S - nums[l] + nums[r]

		C[nums[l]] -= 1

		if C[nums[l]] == 0:
			del C[nums[l]]

		C[nums[r]] += 1

		if len(C) < m:
			continue

		MS = max(MS, S)

	return MS
```
